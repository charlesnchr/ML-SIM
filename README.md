## Read the preprint
ML-SIM: A deep neural network for reconstruction of structured illumination microscopy images
Charles N. Christensen, Edward N. Ward, Pietro Lio, Clemens F. Kaminski

Preprint paper on arXiv [https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11064](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11064) 


## Web app to test the model
There is an online browser-based ready-to-use implementation available at:
[http://ML-SIM.com](http://ML-SIM.com). The model used in this tool assumes that the inputs are 9 frame SIM stacks of 512x512 resolution; i.e. 3 orientations and 3 phase shifts. It will work for other dimensions, but is unlikely to be good.


## Status of repository
The code used for the preprint publication is currently being polished and commented to make it more easy to read. Please look back soon to find the code.
